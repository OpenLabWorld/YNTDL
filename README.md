This is a work in progress.

The purpose of this project is to integrate Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) and Linux Containers (lxc) and automate their usage.

The program will use config/topology files to automate creation of linux containers and interface them with ns-3 to simulate a network.
Settings may be set in the settings.conf file.

Resources including example topology files can be found in the resources folder.
